I am a Ph.D student in Canada. Similar to many other students, I am confused all the time. Sometimes I wondered why I ever chose to pursue a Ph.D degree while my friends working for big companies make a lot of money. Sometimes I felt discouraged because nobody could discuss with me on what I was doing. It feels like I’m walking in the dark and no one could tell you when this will end.

I found Philip Guo a long time ago, after reading his famous ebook The Ph.D Grind. It shows his thoughts when he was doing Ph.D study, which is a great help to me. Then I found his personal website: http://www.pgbovine.net/, the first article of which was in 1998 (the active maintenance started from 2005). He has kept his blogs active for almost 12 years, and accumulated over 500 articles, video, etc. Recently he has also been trying a new format of recording — vlogs and already published 108 videos on Youtube. The return is hard to estimate but evident.

Why I want to do the similar things?

First, English is not my first language. It takes time and hard work for me to grow to a decent writer in English. I will make a lot of mistakes while writing, which is a good thing. These mistakes could help me become a better writer and improve my English levels (vocabulary, etc.).

Second, I have always been troubled by one concern: I kept forgetting the technique skills if I did not use it for a while. And when I have to pick it up, it caused a lot of pain for me to re-google it and scan through stackoverflow posts. These experiences inspire me to record the processes each time I resolve problems. For example, if I need to figure out how to setup an HBase server, I better record the process and the pains in case next time I need to redo it.

Third, communication is crucial. That is why I chose Medium to give it a try. Hopefully, after I insist blogging for a few years or so, the number of articles reach a decent number and at least some of them could be helpful to other people. Through the communication, I can have opportunities to talk to many interesting people and seek for exciting projects to work on. As time goes by, this will build my personal influences as well(Dream about it, ha!) .

So what exactly would I write in the platform? Well, since my day job is to do research. Most of the time I will be reading research papers in the related fields (software engineering) , writing code for experiments, and writing research papers. I will share my immature thoughts, paper reviews, and some technique skills. As said, probably most of the contents here will be related to technique stuff and research life.
