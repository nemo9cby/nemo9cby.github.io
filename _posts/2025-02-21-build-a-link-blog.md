Inspired by Simon Willison, I decided to put some links in my blog for helping myself to finish these links and useful resources, so that I can actually absort this.

Recently, my main focus is on training LLMs for coding/software engineering. Hence the following links might be very helpful:

1. <https://rlhfbook.com/>
2. <https://github.com/therealoliver/Deepdive-llama3-from-scratch/>
3. <https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/ultrascale-playbook/>
4. <https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fineweb-v1/>
5. <https://github.com/Open-Reasoner-Zero/Open-Reasoner-Zero/blob/main/ORZ_paper.pdf/>
6. <https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sd4y167NS/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=30dd777f9dac71e1bdc7362c649969f6/>

These are mostly related to RL and Infra.
