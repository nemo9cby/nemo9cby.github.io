## ðŸ‘¤ About Me

I am a Principal Researcher at Centre for Software Excellence, Huawei Canada.

My current research interests are building **Software Engineering-first LLMs**. Our team's target is to build the most cost-effective SE models (Sonnet is great, but expensive). 

In the past, I lead a research team working on Heterogeneous Computing. In particualr, we focused on building infrastructure for large scale clusters for FMWare (i.e., Software built on Foundational Models). I am also interested in software reproducibility, logging, and AI4SE.
I received my Ph.D degree in Software Engineering from York University, Canada, under supervision of Prof. [Zhen Ming (Jack) Jiang](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~zmjiang/).

Many of our team's work is contributed to [Ray](https://ray.io), a popular open source distributed computing framework. For instance, We provided the native Ascend support for Ray. Our talk at Ray Summit 2024 is [here](https://youtu.be/TSAWC-ZZwv4?si=Ht30wHcPAr2h8Aca).

## ðŸ†• News

**2025-03-28**: We released our recent work on performance enhancement for AI-Native Coding. This work focuses on the Service Level Agreement of LLM serving for coding tasks. We present Coding Assistant Task Orchestrator (CATO), the first SLA-aware algorithms for LLM serving that's been internally deployed into Huawei Cloud and on Ascend NPU clusters. CATO intelligently orchestrates CodeLLMs to meet diverse coding tasks' unique latency requirements while maximizing resource utilization. Compared to model-centric serving approaches (e.g., Ray Serve), we have achieved up to 41.4% improvement on goodput. Check it out at [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19876).
