## About Me

I am currently a Senior Staff Researcher at Centre for Software Excellence, Huawei Canada. I lead the research team on Heterogeneous Computing in the Foundation Model era. I received my Ph.D degree in Software Engineering from York University, Canada. I love doing reserach around software engineering, systems, and [foundation models](https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models). Checkout my [publication](https://nemo9cby.github.io/publications) and my [CV](https://nemo9cby.github.io/cv).
