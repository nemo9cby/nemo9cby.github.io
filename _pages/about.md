I am a Principal Researcher at Centre for Software Excellence, Huawei Canada.
I lead a research team on Heterogeneous Computing. Currently, my research focuses on building infrastructure for large scale clusters for FMWare (i.e., Software based on Foundational Models). I am also interested in software reproducibility, logging, and AI4SE.
I received my Ph.D degree in Software Engineering from York University, Canada, under supervision of Prof. [Zhen Ming (Jack) Jiang](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~zmjiang/).

Many of our team's work is contributed to [Ray](https://ray.io), a popular open source distributed computing framework. For instance, We provided the native Ascend support for Ray.
