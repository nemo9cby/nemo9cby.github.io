Decorators in Python: A common pattern is to use decorators to register functions as handlers for an event
`@app.route('/')`

request can be global accessed. (due to context)
There are two contexts in Flask: application context & request context

view function should return Response to a HTTP request.
It can return one, two or three values as a tuple, or return a *Response* object
"make_response"
